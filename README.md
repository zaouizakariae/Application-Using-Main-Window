# Application-Using-Main-Window
## Intoduction :
A main window provides a framework for building an application's user interface. Qt has QMainWindow and its related classes for main window management. QMainWindow has its own layout to which you can add [Qtoolbar](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtoolbar.html)s, [QDockWidgets](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qdockwidget.html), a [QMenuBar](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qmenubar.html), and a [QStatusBar](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qstatusbar.html). The layout has a center area that can be occupied by any kind of widget. You can see an image of the layout below.
